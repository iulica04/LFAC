🔀 Compiler
This project represents a compiler for an original programming language. This compiler recognizes data types such as int, float, char, string, bool, as well as array types or user defined data types (similar to classes) and is able to identify mathematical expressions in which variables or values are used and perform the calculations related.

The program that this compiler can evaluate must be divided into 4 sections: a section for global variables, a section for functions, a section for user defined data types and a special function representing the entry point of the program. The compiler provides semantic analysis and displays Detailed error messages if there are semantic or syntactic errors, in which case the program will not be executed.
